# FakeKurdNews---Fake-Kurdish-News-Dataset
Context
The majority of the previous studies got focused on detecting fake news in the English language due to the availability of well-known annotated fake corpus openly available, variety of fact-checkers around the world while the less-resourced languages left behind such as the Kurdish language. While the Kurdish language is spoken by more than 30 million people around the world, yet, it is considered as less-resourced in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain due to the inaccessibility of NLP tools and the shortage or unavailability of the labeled corpus.
This is a repository for a fake news dataset for a research project at the College of Informatics, Sulaimani Polytechnic University, Iraq.
